I have developed a web service that provides users with an interactive experience to explore various APIs. 
Through this service, users can access functionalities such as searching for weather forecasts, 
retrieving information about planets, and viewing random images.
 Whether you're interested in checking the weather conditions, 
 learning about different planets, or simply enjoying a surprise image,
  this web service offers a diverse range of experiences for users to enjoy.
  - Forecast weather: input city, state and country
  - Planets: input a name planet
  - random Image: I have specifically chosen adorable fox photos. 
  Foxes are known for their charming appearance and playful nature,
   making them a delightful choice. However, if you prefer a different type of random image,
    you can search random photo API.
